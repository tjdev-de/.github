Why we moved away from GitHub, and why you should do so too:
- GitHub itself is not FOSS; Hosting FOSS code on a proprietary service is just ridiculous
- [GitHub uses licensed code to train their proprietary AI](https://githubcopilotlitigation.com)
- GitHub has a lot of paywalled features and is too bloated in our opinion
- Hosting your code on GitHub's servers bears the risk of them just removing it one day; We like to have our stuff on our own servers
- [Even more reasons from the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub)
